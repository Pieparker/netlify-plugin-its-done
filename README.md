Do you want your Netlify deploy log to tell you when the build phase succeeds?

It's done.

Check out this section of the [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#file-based-installation) for file-based installation instructions.

Thanks to [Cassidoo](https://twitter.com/Netlify/status/1265644146691387394) for being a champion and [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins) for being Netlify.
